## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark forest green (#306754), reminiscent of healthy crops and growth. This is not to be used for the background.
- Background color: Off-white (#F2F4F1) to provide a clean and high-contrast backdrop for data presentation. This color creates an airy feel.
- Accent color: Earthy brown (#A67B5B), an analogous color to the primary that will be used for interactive elements. The analogous accent represents a grounding force.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif.
- Minimalist and linear icons for easy recognition.
- Cards with aggressively rounded corners (border-radius: 16px) and subtle shadows to create depth.
- Use subtle transitions for loading data.
